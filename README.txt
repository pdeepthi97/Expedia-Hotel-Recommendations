All files that begin with classifier_ (classifier_*) are for cross validation for various classifiers:
1. classifier_adaboost.py --> Adaboost
2. classifier_dt.py --> Decision Tree
3. classifier_knn.py --> K Nearest Neighbours
4. classifier_lr.py --> Multinomial Logistic Regression
5. classifier_lsvc.py --> LinearSVC
6. classifier_mnb.py --> Multinomial Naive Bayes
7. classifier_rf.py --> Random Forest
8. classifier_svc.py --> SVC
9. classifier_svr.py --> SVR

All the preprocessing is performed:
preprocessing.ipynb

Training is performed by the train_ code files

Test is performed by the test_ code files

Sampling was done as stratsample.py

Data Visualization code in data_vis.py, data_vis2.py, data_vis3.py, corr.py
